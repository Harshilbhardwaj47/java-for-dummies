					// Sometimes the numbers are so large that exceeds so long is used to take care
					// of that
		System.out.println(A);
		// first statement prints the value stored in long
		System.out.print(abc);
		// second statement is used to print the value stored in the String
		System.out.println(xyz);
		// third statement is used to print value stored in int
		// NOTE:- JAVA is a case sensitive language so S must be capital in the printing
		// Statements as well as in String in future you all will get to know that
		// leaving this where you have to type in caps
